Embedded systems are computer-based systems defined by their simple interface. Identify 2 systems on the market & analyze their interfaces. Describe all inputs to & outputs from each system. Classify inputs & outputs based on their mode of interaction: Visual: data carried by visible light; Audio: data carried by sound; Tactile: data carried by touch: Electronic: data encoded in electrical signal

instructionss:
	Identify two embedded systems which are sold on the market today and analyze their interfaces.

	Describe all inputs to each system and outputs from each system.

	Classify the inputs and outputs based on their mode of interaction:

	- Visual - describing data carried by visible light

	- Audio - describing data carried by sound

	- Tactile - describing data carried by touch

	- Electronic - describing data encoded in electrical signals
