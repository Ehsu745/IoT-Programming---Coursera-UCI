Indicate if there are operating systems which can be used on each platform. If there are, list those operating systems
State whether the operating systems are open source or not.

Question 1:
	Arduino: No(firmware)
	RaspberryPi: Yes, NOOBS and Raspbian

Question 2:
	Arduino: Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control both physically and digitally.
	RaspberryPi: It is, it runs Linux (a variety of distributions), and its main supported operating system, Raspbian, is open source and runs a suite of open source software.
